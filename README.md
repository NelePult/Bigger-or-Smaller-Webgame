### An interactive guessing game ###

"Bigger or Smaller" is an interactive guessing game where players must determine which of two displayed options has the larger value based on a given attribute. 
If the answer is correct, the player earns a point, and the correct image remains while a new challenge appears.

The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### How to Play ###

    Start the game by clicking the "Play" button.
    Two images with a specific question appear (e.g., "Which country has a higher population?").
    Click on the correct option.
    If correct, you gain a point, and a new challenge appears.
    If wrong, the game ends, and your score is displayed.
    Restart the game and try to beat your high score!
